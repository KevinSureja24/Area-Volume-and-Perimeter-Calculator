# Area-Volume-and-Perimeter-Calculator

This program allows users to calculate the area, volume, and perimeter of various geometric shapes. Users can input the dimensions of different shapes, and the program will calculate the corresponding area, volume, or perimeter.

## Features

- Calculate the perimeter of:
  - Square
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle
  - Circle
  - Semi-circle
  - Trapezium

- Calculate the area of:
  - Square
  - Rectangle
  - Triangle
  - Circle
  - Semi-circle
  - Trapezium
